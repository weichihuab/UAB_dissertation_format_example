# UAB_dissertation_format_example

Since UAB does not provide latex template for the thesis/dissertation, students may need to spend many hours to get every formats right. I hope this latex template can save you some time when you're in your last stage of MS/PhD research.

Step 1: Create your overleaf account. (https://www.overleaf.com/)
Step 2: Create a new project.
Step 3: Put main.tex, bibfile.bib, and UAB_Campus_Green.jpg. in the new project.
Step 4: Compile and check the pdf file.
