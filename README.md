# UAB dissertation format example

Since UAB does not provide latex template for the thesis/dissertation, students may need to spend many hours to get every formats right when they are at the last stage of their MS/PhD research. I hope this latex template can save you some time.

Step 1: Create your overleaf account. (https://www.overleaf.com/), and create a new project.

Step 2: Put main.tex, bibfile.bib, and UAB_Campus_Green.jpg. in the new project.

Step 3: Compile and check the pdf file.
